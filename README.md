### My core values âœ…

#### Learning :book:

Learning is a neverending journey.
I deeply believe that misunderstandings are the crux of many problems so I made constant learning a center of my life.
I see knowledge as a tool for empowerment so I'm always striving to keep on learning and sharing knowledge to my peers.

#### Fixing problems ðŸ”§

I don't like problems. Nobody does. As a response to that, I grew good at dealing with them, whether they are technical or human.
As soon as I sense that tension is brewing, I make a point of honor to figure out what is wrong and clean up the situation before if festers.

#### Harmony :cherry_blossom:

I'm an advocate of consensus. I believe that a teams needs to find core areas of agreement in order to thrive.
