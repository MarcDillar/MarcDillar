## ðŸ“š My Values

### Knowledge Sharing ðŸ“–

Iâ€™ve always believed that **learning is a never-ending journey**. For me, knowledge is a foundation for **growth**, **empowerment**, and innovation. But more importantly, **knowledge is meant to be shared**.

Whether itâ€™s mentoring others or leading training sessions, I strive to share what I learnâ€”just as others have done for me. 

I firmly believe that **cooperation, not confrontation**, builds successful teams. Knowledge should be **open, available, and valued** by all.

### Open Mindedness ðŸ”†

I see the world as a mosaic of perspectives, and I embrace the challenge of understanding each one. **Empathy** is a core part of who I am: questioning my beliefs, confronting biases, and seeking to see situations through othersâ€™ eyes.

I value **open discussions** where thoughts and ideas can flow freely, without fear of judgment. I believe in the **wisdom of collaboration**: diverse opinions are our strength as a species, and **open-mindedness** is the key to unlocking that strength.
