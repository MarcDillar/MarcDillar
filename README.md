## Core values âœ…

### Learning :book:

Learning is a neverending journey.
I deeply believe that misunderstandings are the crux of many problems so I made constant learning a center of my life.
I see knowledge as a tool for empowerment so I'm always striving to keep on learning and sharing knowledge to my peers.

### Harmony :cherry_blossom:

I believe that teams should foster harmony and cooperation.
Inclusion takes a key role: all team members need to feel safe, heard and need to know that their voice is valued.
Only can we all thrive if empathy, selflessless, open-mindedness and transparency are etched into the team's DNA.

During these lockdown times this can get quite challenging, but I'm taking at heart to keep on encouraging knowledge sharing as well as open discussions.
