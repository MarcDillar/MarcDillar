## My Values âœ…

### Knowledge Sharing :book:

Since my yougest age, I have been a curious person and I have seen knowledge as fertile ground for growth and empowerment.
Learning is a neverending journey and it's a path I'm following every single day of my life. A day without learning is a day lost.

But more important than that, knowledge is worth nothing if it's not shared.
When I'm learning something new, the first thing I'm striving to do is to share this fresh new knowledge to my peers, just like so many others (teachers, friends or peers) shared their knowledge with me.

I believe in cooperation, not in confrontation. A team, a group, a people where knowledge is withheld by the lucky few is ineluctably bound to fail.
That is why, my number 1 conviction is that all knowledge should be open, available, spread and valued.

### Open Mindedness :high_brightness:

We all only see the world through our own eyes but we need to be conscious that every single person envisions the universe in their own way.
I am a deeply empathetic person and this is a trait of my personality I cherish. Questionning my beliefs, fighting my bias, envisioning situations from the others' perspective is part of my DNA. Keeping an open mind helps me not getting stuck in my own thoughts pattern.

That is why I value open discussions, where opinions and thoughts can be shared without the fear of being judged.
I believe in the wisdom of the crowd: difference of opinions is what makes our strength as a collaborative species.
And this can only be reached by encouraging open mindedness in every aspect of our lives.
