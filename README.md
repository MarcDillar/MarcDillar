## My Fuel âœ…

### Learning :book:

Learning is a neverending journey.
I deeply believe that misunderstandings are the crux of many problems so I made constant learning a center of my life.
I see knowledge as a tool for empowerment so I'm always striving to keep on learning and sharing knowledge to my peers.

### Open Mindedness :high_brightness:

Plato said "I know that I know nothing". I guess this describes my current state of mind.
I believe I'm right in the middle of the valley of despair described by David Dunning and Justin Kruger. The "slope of enlightment" is still ahead of me and it is a long and steep way.
My best ally to climb this path is to remain open to the world during this pivotal moment. Doubting my beliefs, questioning my bias, listening to others provide grist to my mill.
Open Mindedness is my hiking pole on my way up.

### Harmony :cherry_blossom:

I believe that teams should foster harmony and cooperation.
Inclusion takes a key role: all team members need to feel safe, heard and need to know that their voice is valued.
Only can we all thrive if empathy, selflessness, open-mindedness and transparency are etched into the team's DNA. During these lockdown times this can be challenging, but I'm taking at heart to keep on encouraging open discussions.
